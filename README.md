InteractiveDialView
===================

In production, early stages.

Specialized view that can be used in Android applications that gives a nice circular control with a button on the outside of the circle that can only move with the bounds of the circle itself. While moving the button around the cirlce it controls whatever you decide to put in the middle with a listener callback.
